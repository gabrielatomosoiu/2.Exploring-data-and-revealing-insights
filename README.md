# 2.Exploring data and revealing insights

This project aims to showcase my data analysis skills using real-world data from the Bucharest Stock Exchange (BVB).
This project is particularly relevant because I'm also an investor. It allows me to explore my investing opportunities while demonstrating valuable data skills. Also, this project demonstrates my abilities to:
- extract and clean data from a financial database (data cleaning);
- write SQL queries to perform calculations and aggregations (SQL programming);
- prepare data for visualization in tools like Tableau (data preparation);
- calculate investment performance metrics (financial analysis).
